# ABSTRACT: Microsoft Teams WebHook with AdaptiveCards for formatting notifications

=encoding utf-8

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Sample usage to post notifications using Microsoft::Teams::WebHook

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Microsoft::Teams::WebHook

Set of helpers to send plain or AdaptiveCard notifications

=head1 Constructor attributes

=head2 url [required]

The backend C<url> for your Teams webhook

=head2 json [optional]

This is optional and allow you to provide an alternate JSON object
to format the output sent to post queries.

One JSON::MaybeXS with the flavor of your choice.
By default C<utf8 = 0, pretty = 1>.

=head2 auto_detect_utf8 [default=true] [optional]

You can provide a boolean to automatically try to detect utf8 strings
and enable the utf8 flag.

This is on by default but you can disable it by using

    my $hook = Slack::WebHook->new( ..., auto_detect_utf8 => 0 );

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new( [url => "https://..." ] )

This is the constructor for L<Microsoft::Teams::WebHook>. You should provide the C<url> for your webhook.
You should visit the L<official Microsoft documentation page|https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook?tabs=dotnet>
for information on how to create this URL.

=head2 post( $message )

The L<post> method allows you to post a single message without applying any formatting.
The return value is the return of L<HTTP::Tiny::post> which is one C<Hash Ref>.
The C<success> field will be true if the status code is 2xx.

The other C<post_*> methods format the message contents in L<AdaptiveCards|https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/connectors-using?tabs=cURL#send-adaptive-cards-using-an-incoming-webhook>
whereas this method allows you to send a simple, unformatted plaintext message 
or provide a C<HashRef> structure (which will be converted to a JSON string) for
custom C<AdaptiveCards>.

=head2 post_ok( $message, [ @list ])

Post a message to the Teams WebHook URL. There are two methods of calling a C<post_*> method.

You may either pass a simple string argument to the function

    Microsoft::Teams::WebHook->new(url => ...)->post_ok( q{posting a simple "ok" text} );

or you can pass a hash (not a hashref!) with a required C<text> key

    Microsoft::Teams::WebHook->new(url => ...)->post_ok(text => q{your notification message});

Using the latter form, you may also optionally add C<title> and C<text_color> (for C<post_ok> only!) keys
to set those additional parameters in the resulting AdaptiveCard. If C<text_color> is specified,
it must be one of the allowed AdaptiveCard colors (see L<documentation|https://adaptivecards.io/explorer/TextRun.html>) 
which as of this writing are: C<default>, C<dark>, C<light>, C<accent>, C<good>, C<warning>, and C<attention>.

    Microsoft::Teams::WebHook->new(url => ...)->post_ok(
      title      => q{YOUR NOTIFICATION TITLE},
      text       => q{your notification message},
      text_color => 'light'
    );

C<post_ok> defaults to C<good> text color if none is given.

The return value of the C<post_*> method is one L<HTTP::Tiny> response, a C<HashRef>
containing the C<success> field, which is true on success.

=head2 post_warning( $message, [ @list ])

Similar to L<post_ok>, but the color used to display the message is C<warning> and
cannot be overridden.

=head2 post_info( $message, [ @list ])

Similar to L<post_ok>, but the color used to display the message is C<accent> and
cannot be overridden.

=head2 post_error( $message, [ @list ])

Similar to L<post_ok>, but the color used to display the message is C<attention> and
cannot be overridden.

=head2 post_start( $message, [ @list ])

Similar to L<post_ok>, but the color used to display the message is C<accent> and
cannot be overridden. Additionally, this method starts a timer, which is used by 
L<post_end>.

=head2 post_warning( $message, [ @list ])

Similar to L<post_ok>, but the default color used to display the message is C<good>. 
An additional italicized, C<default>-colored line is appended to the AdaptiveCard
which displays a human-readable format of the elapsed time since C<post_start>
was called.

If C<post_start> was not previously called (or not called since the last C<post_end>)
the timer is considered to have no value and the elapsed time section will not 
be added.

=head1 CREDITS

This module is heavily based on the excellent work done on L<Slack::WebHook> 
(and as such intended to be largely drop-in compatible)
